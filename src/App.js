            <h1>Hi! im Irakli</h1>
            <h3>These are my <b>SMART goals</b></h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Specific: </strong>
            My main goal is to become a programmer and I started my way in SkillWill, studying Front-end development. I`m interested in programming since childhood so I decided that I must reach my main goal.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Measurable: </strong>
            Since I introduced myself I would like to tell how often I study programming. It takes around 2-3 hours per day sometimes 3-4 hours of work.  
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Attainable: </strong>
            I believe my goal is achievable because I don't give up, and I'm pursuing it with all my heart. There are times when I make mistakes and feel like giving up, but then I realize that mistakes are opportunities for learning and getting motivated to keep going and not giving up that easily.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Relevant: </strong>
            I'm dedicated to becoming a programmer because I love this profession. Besides this, I don't see anything else I'd rather be than a programmer.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Time bound: </strong>
            I started studying Python when I was 14, and it`s helping me now with JavaScript. I'm 17 now and planning to become a professional programmer in 1-2 years, hoping to start working with SkillWill.
